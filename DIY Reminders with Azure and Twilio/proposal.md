> Outline learning/teaching structure

**Beginning**
{Before we start, we need to have an active Microsoft Azure account which we can sign up for free for 12 months. We'll cover all the required setup including how to create a function app in Azure. This will also be the section where we make sure the user is good to go and has everything they need for this project.}

**Middle**
{This will be a step by step walkthrough of the code firstly in Azure, then the Twilio integration. This will also have sections to set up text and call notification through Twilio.}

**End**
{Here we can test the code and check that everything works. Here we'll also include final checks like the timestamp is in the correct format and such.}
