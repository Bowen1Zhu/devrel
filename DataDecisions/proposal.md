### :pushpin: Step 1
**TITLE:**    
Intro to Data-Driven Decisions

**TOPIC:**    
Probability and Statistics

**DESCRIPTION (5-7+ sentences):**    
At a high level, game theory and statistics are extremely useful to large swaths of the population that have no training to use it effectively. Business decision-makers, scientists and researchers, and engineers alike all benefit from being able to better translate information and data into justified conclusions. This goes for low-level IC's to top executives, and it produces better outcomes in situations that demand justification and saves projects that are at risk of manipulation and misinterpretation. In this product, we discuss what should trigger this frame of thinking, and we equip the students to have clarity of thought in these potentially stressful situations. The content will cover some common examples, some useful models to apply in producing these solutions, and some walkthrough-style practice.

:family: **TARGET AUDIENCE (3-5+ sentences):**    
The amount of prior knowledge required is very small, and it should be easy to get caught up on, so most college students and dedicated High School students could follow along. This in mind, the topics will only really be relevant to those who do or want to deal with data analysis, business decision making, or similar. All in all, presenting this to a class of engineering, business, or math/stats students would be appropriate, and that is what the content will be designed to serve best.

> Outline your learning/teaching structure:

**Beginning (2-3+ sentences):**    
Here we find out what kinds of information feeds good decision making. This will be a high-level overview of stakeholders, fallacies like p-hacking, and some useful datasets, the last of which feeds into the middle section

**Middle (2-3+ sentences):**    
Here, we walk through a specific dataset in a development-team environment to make some decisions. This will likely _look like_ the scientific/engineering method: question, hypothesis, testing/evidence (the data part), conclusion/iteration.

**End (2-3+ sentences):**    
Here we give some resources that should be directly applicable. List of applicable datasets, examples of doing this well, examples of doing this poorly, etc. The takeaway is that the way you solve certain problems should have some burden of proof, which they are now better equipped to bring about.
