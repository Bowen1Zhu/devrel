### :pushpin: Step 1
**TITLE:**    
Intro To Python Pandas

**TOPIC:**    
Intro to Python, Intro to Data Science, Big Data

**DESCRIPTION (5-7+ sentences):**    

**NOTE:** All code is placed in my blog.md, there is not seperate file for it.

My blog aims to help people of all skill levels develop a fundamental understanding of the Python Pandas library. Python Pandas is one of the most popular libraries in all of computer science. It is able to perform powerful commands with only a few lines of code, and is the foundation of many complex data science projects. I break the tutorial down into bite-sized segments that categorize some of the primary uses of Pandas. Each tutorial comes with a simple exercise to help apply the newly learned topics.

:family: **TARGET AUDIENCE (3-5+ sentences):**    

Since this is only an introduction, my blog is intended to reach out to as many people as possible. I am aiming to help non-coders try and take their first steps, but still be vauable to people other than complete novices. My primary focus is to ensure that people can feel comfortable and confident after the tutorial and explore the more complex parts of Pandas (and coding in general).

> Outline your learning/teaching structure: 

**Beginning (2-3+ sentences):**    

The blog starts with some background on Pandas and why having pre-written libraries is useful. I also show a quote from the creator of Pandas to highlight how it is meant to help new programmers work efficiently. I also mention a statistic showing how one percent of all Stack Overflow questions are about Pandas, showing how popular it is.

**Middle (2-3+ sentences):**    
I go over a brief installation for a Python IDE and provide a link to a sample data set to use for the tutorial. I then provide a to do list of the various abilties we will learn using Python. and show how to install it on the IDE. I then present the first set of commands to learn, setting up a exercise followed by solution format.

**End (2-3+ sentences):**    
I repeat the format for the other categories listed in the to do list, and trying to highlight the less intuitive parts of Pandas throughout explanations of the different categories. I then provide a final two part exercise trying to use multiple aspects of what was previously covered to add some stakes and make the reader feel accomplished and confident in what they learned. A brief congratulations message at the end showing what the reader was able to do serves to boost that confidence further.
